<p>These pancakes are a wonderful substitute for regular pancakes when you are watching your carbs! They are very filling and are on the dense side. This is a basic recipe can be tweaked. Any sweetener can be substituted for the maple syrup. Enjoy!</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
    <li>¼ cup water</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon oil, or as needed</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk almond flour, water, eggs, maple syrup, and salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
</ol>
